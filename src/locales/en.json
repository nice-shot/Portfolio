There I was exposed to the world of Cinema and Art and with time it became a major part of my life. During school I've tried my hand in writing, directing, produceding and editing short films. Additionally I've had some experience with graphic design and drawing in photoshop. After school I've worked for a while in \"eCamp\" summer camp where I taught a course about digital comics and special effects with Adobe After Effects.\nIn the army I went through the \"Ahm-Schakim\" course and arrived at the Intelligence corps. In my service I've worked mainly with computers and other technological fields but I could still find some chances to use the artistic skills I've learned in high school. Today I am working in \"Fabrix Systems\", a high-tech company that creates video systems for cable companies.\nAmong other things, I've worked on video games, learned figure drawing from former Bezalel animation department head, Yossi Abolafia, and made some editing and design works here and there.\nI'm a big fan of the world of animation, whether it's full feature films, tv shows or short films, and I'd like to learn and work in this field. I'd be happy to learn in your institute."
